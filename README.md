Goal:
      The goal of the project is to generate a boggle board of a given size. Then, using that boggle board,
      it will find all of the possible words that can be created using that boggle board. To do so, this program
      uses recursive methods. 
      
Note:
      The amount of time the project takes to run is directly related to the size of the board used as all of the
      different permutations and combinations of letters have to be calculated.
